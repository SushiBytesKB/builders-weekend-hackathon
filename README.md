# AI-Powered NPC System
Team Edwin Members: Sushant, Andrew, Bettina

Description: The rise of AI-powered technology within the gaming industry has shifted the dynamics of the gaming experience, evident from NVIDIA's launch of ACE. Moreover, the interactions between players and NPCs have become too static. Integrating Artificial Intelligence into NPCs would allow the player-base to have a dynamic experience. Instead of having large decision trees for story progression and limiting dialogue options for the player, NPC interactions can be AI-powered to allow for regular conversation, automized game-progression, and realism. As a result, game developers will require easy-to-deploy systems to create multiple AI-powered NPCs effortlessly. The project consists of Xpress AI Agents, Python Flask, and Unreal Engine 5 to simulate the concept of AI-powered NPC Systems.

Python Flask Server (eldrinAINPC_Main.py):
- Used for handling API communication between Eldrin AI and Unreal Engine 5. 

Unreal Engine 5 (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AFZGBoGqBQZDqhiYVZ6WGK8xP0yza8WU/view?usp=sharing):
- Consists of the game environment and blueprints to simulate player-and-NPC interactions with Eldrin AI. 

Xpress.ai (Xircuits):
- NPC Script Agent (Eldrin)
- Game Scripting Engineer (Xpress.ai AI Agent Job Description)
